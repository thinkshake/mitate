## Risk Assessment

| Phase | Risk | Mitigation |
|-------|------|------------|
| schema-migration | Existing data migration | Keep old columns, add new ones |
| api-extension | Breaking API changes | Version responses, update frontend in sync |
| ui-foundation | shadcn version conflicts | Use apps/mock versions, test early |
| market-pages | XRPL transaction changes | Multi-outcome tokens need new currency codes |
| user-features | Weight calculation edge cases | Cap at 0.5-3.0 range |
